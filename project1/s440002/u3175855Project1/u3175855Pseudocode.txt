Final Reflection:
For this project I mainly focused on adding elements such as 
the colourful dots and changing backgrounds rather than get 
bogged down too much on creating shapes to make the portrait look 
more like me. 

Code explanation: 
first I declared all the variables, I then created the canvas
with a 400 by 400 size and randomized the background 
I also set the framerate to 3 frames per second to make the 
page run 3 times per second, which means that a dot will be 
generated, and the shirt colour, will change 3 times per second

Next the draw function handles drawing the mouse circles, the 
background dots, and the actual portrait drawing itself. 
Mouse circles uses the position of the mouse on the canvas to 
create a new circle wherever the mouse happens to be on the canvas
at each frame refresh. 

Background dots appear on each frame refresh at a random location on the 
canvas, note that there is a restriction on how low the dots can 
appear on the y axis. 

The portrait was generated neck, shirt, neck base, head, mouth, hair
, eye, pupil and eyebrows in that order. It is drawn in this order
so that each shape is properly placed and drawn in the correct order

The mousePressed Function simply randomizes the background colour
when pressed.
