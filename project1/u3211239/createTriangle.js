/*  This function creates an equilateral triangle based on only a centre position and a height value.
    Normally you'd need to pass 3 points to the standard triangle function so that it could draw 3
    lines between them. This function will generate those points itself (relative to the centre
    point). It doesn't even use trigonometry ... which is nice for the CPU.
